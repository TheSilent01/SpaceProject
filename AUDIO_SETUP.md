# 🎤 Creating the Intro.mp3 Audio File

Since I can't directly generate TTS audio files, here are the best ways to create the realistic `intro.mp3` for Project NOVA:

## 🚀 **Quickest Method: Use LuvVoice (FREE)**

1. **Go to**: https://luvvoice.com/
2. **Paste this text**:
   ```
   Welcome, Cadet. You've been selected for Project NOVA. Our satellite Echo-5 has gone silent in orbit around Kepler-186f. We need your help to restore contact. Time is critical. Proceed with caution.
   ```
3. **Choose a voice**: Select "Jenny (Female)" or "Davis (Male)" for professional sound
4. **Click Generate** and **Download MP3**
5. **Save as**: `public/audio/intro.mp3` in your project

## 📁 **File Placement**

    intro.mp3  ← Place your downloaded file here
```

## 🎛️ **Voice Recommendations**
For a **sci-fi mission briefing**, choose:
- **Male voices**: Professional, authoritative tone
- **Female voices**: Clear, commanding presence
- **Speed**: Normal to slightly slower for dramatic effect
- **Pitch**: Standard (avoid too high/low)

## 🔧 **Quick Test**
After placing the file, the intro screen will automatically use it instead of the placeholder audio.

**Estimated time**: 2-3 minutes to generate and place the file!
